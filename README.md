### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I set up my account on Github quite long ago but I never really thought about using it. Since I used to think it's more for coding masters having a great knowledge of multiple languages while R is enough for my courseworks, dissertation and data analysis projects and it seemed unnecessary to hop between different platforms with similar work. 

However, I decide to take it serisouly as it is really great for version control whenever I need to collaborate with other people. And it is a pretty safe place to store my hard work in case I carelessly lose all of local files. That is already scary to picture!âš¡ And I realise the importance of using Github to build my portfolio.

Yet I still think R/RStudio is a very comprehensive tool for data analytics, particularly statistics, which was my major subject at uni. As an aspiring data analyst, I am also open to other tools and have learned MySQL, Tableau. Python is on the list!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my portfolio and looking for job as a data analysis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Advanced Economics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mostly R.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **How to become a data scientist**.
